# Is School Performance Predicted By Socioeconomic Factors?

# What Is The Purpose Of The Project?
- The project addresses inequality of educational opportunity in U.S. high schools. Here we will focus on average student performance on the ACT or SAT exams that students take as part of the college application process. We expect a range of school performance on these exams, but is school performance predicted by socioeconomic factors?

# Data
- This project utilizes two data sets https://github.com/varelandrew/Education/blob/main/EdGap_data.xlsx and https://www.dropbox.com/s/lkl5nvcdmwyoban/ccd_sch_029_1617_w_1a_11212017.csv?dl=0. The primary data set is the EdGap data set from https://www.edgap.org/#5/37.875/-96.987. This data set from 2016 includes information about average ACT or SAT scores for schools and several socioeconomic characteristics of the school district. The secondary data set is basic information about each school from https://nces.ed.gov/ccd/pubschuniv.asp.
